Code linting
Code linting is the process of analyzing code for potential errors, coding style inconsistencies, or problematic patterns that could lead to issues.
To create a JavaScript code editor with error highlighting, we can use CodeMirror, a popular online code editor library. CodeMirror provides syntax highlighting, error handling, and support for JavaScript and other languages.
To create a Python code editor with error highlighting, we can use CodeMirror along with Pyodide, which allows Python code to run in the browser. CodeMirror handles the code editor interface and syntax highlighting, while Pyodide executes the Python code and identifies syntax errors.
